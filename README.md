This repository contains the software for the second generation of Poseidon, USU's latest autonomous submarine.
This submarine is the third generation of our submarine, built by the mechanical, electrical, and software engineers at Utah State University.
The quality of Poseidon sets it apart from previous generations of submarines. Poseidon contains cutting edge hardware, has an easy to maintain design, and cleaner code.
