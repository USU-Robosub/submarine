### C++ Core Guidelines

This repository contains the Microsoft implementation of the Guideline Support Library for C++.
The headers are located in `extern/gsi/...`.
The support library includes types and functions aimed at keeping C++ code safe and readable.

The full set of C++ guidelines maintained by the Standard C++ Foundation can be [found on Github](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines).
